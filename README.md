# 📚 Books to Scrape – Web Scraping & EDA Project

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow using web scraping and exploratory data analysis (EDA). Book-related data such as price, rating, availability, and category was scraped from the publicly available **Books to Scrape** website using Python.

## 🎯 Business Objectives
- Collect structured book data using automated web scraping
- Analyze pricing and rating patterns
- Identify popular and highly rated books
- Convert raw web data into actionable insights
- Demonstrate real-world data analyst skills

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- BeautifulSoup
- Requests
- Pandas
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Dataset Details
**Source:** Books to Scrape (public website)  
**Attributes:** Title, Price, Rating, Availability, Category, Stock, URL  
**Format:** CSV / Pandas DataFrame

## 🧹 Data Cleaning
- Removed duplicates
- Handled missing values
- Converted price (£) to numeric
- Converted rating text (One, Two, Three…) to numeric

## 📈 Key Insights
- Most books fall in the £20–£40 price range
- Higher-rated books have slightly higher average prices
- Ratings and prices show a weak relationship
- Ratings are fairly evenly distributed

## ⚠ Challenges
- Inconsistent HTML structure
- Missing tags during scraping
- Pagination handling
- Text-to-numeric conversions

## 📌 Conclusion & Recommendations
- Focus on mid-priced books
- Use ratings with other factors for recommendations
- Automate periodic scraping for trend analysis
- Extend analysis with category-level insights
